    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Oats</li>
        <li>1 scoop protein powder</li>
        <li>30 grams pistachios</li>
        <li>20 grams honey</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>blueberries</li>
        <li>apple (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the base: In a jar or bowl, add 1 cup of oats. Pour in enough milk to fully cover the oats (about 1–1.5 cups, depending on how thick you want it).</li>
        <li>Mix in protein: Stir in 1 scoop of protein powder until fully dissolved with the oats and milk. This will enrich the oats with flavor and nutrition.</li>
        <li>Add sweetness: Drizzle 20 grams of honey into the mixture and stir well so the sweetness is evenly spread.</li>
        <li>Incorporate nuts: Roughly chop or crush 30 grams of pistachios and mix them into the oats for crunch and healthy fats.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate overnight: Cover the jar or bowl and refrigerate for at least 6–8 hours (or overnight) so the oats absorb the liquid and soften.</li>
        <li>Add fresh toppings: In the morning, stir the oats and top with fresh blueberries. If desired, dice an apple and add it for extra crunch and fiber.</li>
        <li>Serve chilled: Enjoy straight from the fridge, or add a splash of extra milk if you prefer a looser consistency.</li>
    </ol>
