    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Ginger/Garlic</li>
        <li>Cashews</li>
        <li>Ground Spices</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cream (Option)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the base: Chop the onions and tomatoes. Soak cashews in warm water for 10–15 minutes, then grind them into a smooth paste. Crush or finely chop ginger and garlic.</li>
        <li>Cook the onions: Heat butter in a pan, add the chopped onions, and sauté until golden brown. This step builds the sweetness and depth of the gravy.</li>
        <li>Add aromatics and tomatoes: Stir in the ginger-garlic, let the raw smell fade, then add chopped tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes soften and blend with the onions.</li>
        <li>Blend into a smooth gravy: Once cooled slightly, blend the onion-tomato mixture with the cashew paste into a silky puree. This gives paneer masala its rich and creamy body.</li>
        <li>Simmer with spices: Return the puree to the pan, add ground spices (turmeric, chili powder, coriander, garam masala, etc.), and let it cook in butter until the oil separates. Add a little water if too thick.</li>
        <li>Finish the gravy: Stir in cream (optional, for extra richness) and adjust the consistency by adding water as needed. Simmer gently to let flavors meld.</li>
        <li>Add paneer and serve: Gently add paneer cubes, stir carefully, and simmer for 2–3 minutes. Garnish with fresh cream or coriander leaves if available, then serve hot with roti, naan, or rice.</li>
    </ol>
