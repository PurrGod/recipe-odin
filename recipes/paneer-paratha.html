    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour (for dough)</li>
        <li>200–250 g paneer (grated)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (finely chopped, optional)</li>
        <li>1–2 green chilies (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh coriander leaves (chopped)</li>
        <li>½ tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>½ tsp chili powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Water (for kneading dough)</li>
        <li>Ghee or oil (for roasting)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: In a mixing bowl, add whole wheat flour, a pinch of salt, and water gradually. Knead into a smooth, soft dough (similar to roti dough). Cover and let it rest for 20–30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the stuffing: In another bowl, add grated paneer, chopped onions, green chilies, coriander leaves, cumin powder, garam masala, chili powder, and salt. Mix everything gently to form a uniform stuffin..</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: Divide the dough into medium-sized balls. Roll out one ball into a small circle (like a puri).</li>
        <li>Add the stuffing: Place 2–3 tablespoons of paneer mixture in the center of the rolled dough. Bring the edges together and pinch to seal it like a pouch.</li>
        <li>Flatten and roll: Dust with flour and gently roll it out into a flat paratha (about 6–7 inches wide). Roll lightly so the stuffing doesn’t spill out.</li>
        <li>Cook the paratha: Heat a tawa (flat pan). Place the paratha on it and cook until bubbles form. Flip, apply ghee or oil, and cook both sides until golden brown spots appear.</li>
        <li>Serve hot: Stack them up and serve with yogurt, butter, or pickle on the side.</li>
    </ol>
